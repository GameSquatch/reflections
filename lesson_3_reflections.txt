When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

When you're working on a project publically, or when you need to be
able to access your own work from multiple computers or locations.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you could be at a different point, locally, on your project
than the one on the remote repository.
